# Onto Tracker

**Manage projects according to an ontology.**

Create an obsidian vault that tracks the contents of a folder on your computer. Files are categorized accrodign to a given ontology according to a set of user-defined rules. This content can then be parsed for tasks such as uploading content to a CMS.

## Usage

1. Project settings

![project settings](/docs/project_settings.png)

Activate the plugin, then in the settings, give your project a title and set the source folder that contains all of the files you wish to track.

Then set an ontology file - [here is an example](https://zenodo.org/records/8084209) of an ontology that is used to preserve electroacoustic music projects called Eulalie. Download the file [here](https://zenodo.org/records/8084209/files/Eulalie.php.xml?download=1).
