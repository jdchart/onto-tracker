# Onto Tracker

**Manage projects according to an ontology.**

Create an obsidian vault that tracks the contents of a folder on your computer. Files are categorized accrodign to a given ontology according to a set of user-defined rules. This content can then be parsed for tasks such as uploading content to a CMS.

## Usage

1. Project settings

![project settings](/docs/project_settings.png)

Activate the plugin, then in the settings, give your project a title and set the source folder that contains all of the files you wish to track.

Then set an ontology file - [here is an example](https://zenodo.org/records/8084209) of an ontology that is used to preserve electroacoustic music projects called Eulalie. Download the file [here](https://zenodo.org/records/8084209/files/Eulalie.php.xml?download=1).

2. Unpack ontology

![unpack onto tab](/docs/ontos_1.png)

When the plugin is active, a menu will appear in Obsidian's main ribbon. You can click `Unpack ontology...` to get a better idea about how your ontology works.

![unpack onto settings tab](/docs/ontos_2.png)

You can set a name for the folder that will be created.

![ontoilogy unpacked](/docs/ontos_3.png)

You will see that a folder called `ontos` will be created at the root of your vault. Here you will find your ontology that has been unpacked which you can view as needed.
